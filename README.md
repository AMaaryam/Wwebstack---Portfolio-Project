# webstack-Portfolio-Project 
# Bee ChatApp,  is a real-time chat application allowing users to send and receive instant text messages.
Core features: instant messaging, notifications, online statuses, friend lists, and user profiles.
the technologies  I plan to use for building ChatApp:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + a JavaScript framework of your choice
Backend: Node.js (explore other options based on your learning)
# # Database:
Relational database (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).
I will use third-party services for functionalities (e.g., third-party chat API, push notification service).
potential challenges I might face:
Managing real-time communication between users
Ensuring message and user data security
Optimizing application performance for a smooth user experience
